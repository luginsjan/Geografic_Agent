# PDF Export Lessons Log

## What Worked (Test File)
- **Section Grouping:** Grouping report sections/cards so as many as fit appear per page, never splitting a card.
- **Chart Handling:** Replacing `<canvas>` charts with images before export ensures charts appear in the PDF.
- **Consistent Styling:** Report header and cards have the same card-like appearance (gray background, border, rounded corners).
- **Minimal, Robust Export Logic:** PDF export logic is self-contained and does not interfere with the rest of the UI or data flow.
- **No Blank Pages or Cut Content:** Export is robust against blank pages, missing cards, or split content.

## What Did Not Work (Previous Approaches)
- **Direct html2pdf/html2canvas Export:** Exporting the whole report container at once led to blank pages, cards being split, or missing/cut-off charts.
- **Relying on CSS Page Breaks:** CSS page-break rules were not reliably respected by html2pdf/html2canvas, especially with dynamic content and charts.
- **Not Handling Canvases:** If canvases were not replaced with images, charts would be missing in the PDF.

## Issues Encountered During Website Integration
- **Overwriting Existing Logic:** Replacing the main export function broke other workflows (input, agent, etc.).
- **DOM Manipulation Side Effects:** Cloning/appending nodes risked interfering with the live DOM and event listeners.
- **Assumptions About Structure:** If required elements were missing, the export would throw and halt JS execution.
- **Global State Issues:** Export logic may have conflicted with global variables or state.
- **Event Listener Rebinding:** Replacing event handlers could break other UI flows.

## Safer, Incremental Approach (Recommended)
1. **Isolate the Export Logic:** Add a new export function (e.g., `downloadPDFRobust`) and test it separately.
2. **Defensive Programming:** Check for all required DOM elements and fail gracefully if not present.
3. **No Side Effects on Live DOM:** Only append off-screen wrappers, never modify the main DOM.
4. **No Changes to Global State:** Only read from, never modify, global variables.
5. **Minimal CSS Changes:** Only update CSS as needed, and test visually.
6. **Stepwise Integration:** Test the new export logic in isolation, then replace the old logic if confirmed working.
7. **Logging and Error Handling:** Add logs and user-facing error messages for all major steps.
